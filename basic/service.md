# Common Services
## Apache
> Use

use Apache to set up your own web server, from which you could:
- serve up malware via crossÂ­site scripting (XSS) to anyone who visits your site
- you could clone a website and redirect traffic to your site via abuse of the Domain Name System (DNS).

> Install


```bash
$ apt-get install apache2
```

> Service

```bash
$ service apache2 start|stop|restart
```
- configuration change:  
  when you make a **configuration change** to an application or service by altering its plaintext configuration file, you **need to restart** the service to capture the new configuration.
